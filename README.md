# Object-Orientation Practice

Object-Orientation is a design pattern
used in many programming languages. Object-Orientation
means to take data and behaviors that are related
to each other and encapsulate them both into a code 
object. The result is highly modular code that is easier
to understand, use and build upon. 

In this section are lessons and labs on object-orientation
that touch on topics including:

* Reviewing Ruby object-orientation fundamentals
* Comparing object-oriented code and procedural code
* Working with instance methods and variables
* Building associations between objects

In addition, here are some resources you may find helpful:
